		<h1> Interest in IT </h1>
		<article>
			<p> The first spark of interest in IT began when I was around eight years old, with my older sister playing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64. I would spend hours watching her play and would be completely enraptured by the game and the technology behind it. My interest in technology in general then grew from there. I would play games on the chunky family computer and would tinker with programs like Microsoft Paint or Publisher. My interest in programs continued to grow as I got older and I found video games and creative programs was what I was most drawn to. I realised more recently through a programming game on my Nintendo Switch that IT was a subject I wanted to have more knowledge on and I wanted to start pursuing as a career. </p>
			<p> When I first realised I wanted to study IT I found myself at a standstill. Working full time in Accounts, I felt like I had missed my opportunity to grow and change careers as there was no way I could attend university and continue to support myself financially. That’s when I came across online university options and this led me to RMIT. I had heard good things about RMIT from a few family members that are based in Melbourne and so I became confident that this was a university that was going to offer me the education I was looking for in the best way to suit me. </p>
			<p> During my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to learn a lot more about the fundamentals of IT. My current knowledge base is very limited and I am excited to see how much more there is to learn about. Even from viewing the subjects that are needed to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology, I can already see that there are so many things I wasn’t aware of that are involved in IT. </p>

				<h3> My Skills </h3>
					<p> 2 columns - 6 skills - evenly placed </p>

				<h3> Why Game Design? </h3>
					<p> Games have always been my interest since a young age. Sitting and watching my sister play, to playing games myself, I have always found them fascinating, and not only because of their storylines and quests. Being able to control a character and explore new worlds through a machine and TV screen is, maybe not very impressive to some, but has always been and will always be an amazing and fascinating feat. </p>
					<p> Being able to work within a team and design a game would be an unbelievable job for me. I believe day to day, the position would continuously challenge designers to stay on top of trends and appeal to their clientele and everyday gamer. </p>
					<p> It would be an ever changing career that would allow me to grow. It would challenge me to be creative and push teh boundaires of video game technology. </p>

				<h3> My Plan for Success </h3>
					<p> Currently, I am completeing a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT. With the degree, I hope to gain the knowledge and skills I need to begin my career in IT. I don't believe I will be making my debut into the IT working world as a Game Designer but will be aiming for an entry level position that allows me to continue to gain experience and further my knowledge in the field. </p>
					<p> Once I have found a foot in the field, I plan to undertake further studies focusing on Game Design specifically. This should help to gain further skills and knowledge and will show future employees that I have taken the time to study further for the career I am aiming towards. I would also love to work on some solo, hobby projects during my own time to slowly build a portfolio of my experience and creative designs in gaming. I believe mobile games will be a great start. </p>
					<p> I am sure as I continue to learn more about IT, my plans may change or morph to better suit but for now, I plan to do my best to aim for a Game Design position. </p>

		<h1> Project Idea </h1>

		<article>
		<div id="project">
			<h3> Overview </h3>
				<p> This project would be a mobile application that combines both responsibility and recreation. The application would be a tracker of your savings combined with a game. Each time you put money towards your saving goals or each time you hit a certain milestone, you would be rewarded within the game, whether it helps you progress further into the game or rewards you with an item etc. </p>

			<h3> Motivation </h3>
				<p> From a young age, many people within the world get their first job and start saving money. In Australia alone, the average age of first employment is 16 years old. However, there are still  a lot of people who struggle to save money. </p>
				<p> With this application, the aim would be to help motivate people to save money in a fun and enjoyable manner, while still keeping close track of the in and out of their money. Instead of it being an arduous task with messy tracking of information, the application would make saving fun and enjoyable, while still keeping a close eye on your daily finances. </p>
				<p> With an average of 89% of Australians using smartphones daily, this application would appeal to a large market of users who struggle to keep up with saving goals. </p>

			<h3> Description </h3>
				<p> My project is a money tracking, mobile application. Simple and definitely done before. However from personal experience, I’ve always found these applications to be lacking. Either there is too much information and it’s not kept simple, or there’s not enough information. Plus - it’s boring. No one wants to track their money and think about their saving goals/expenses. That’s where my project idea differs from the usual money tracking apps. My application will incorporate an idle clicker mobile game. </p>
				<p> When opening the application, the screen will open up to a title page which you can tap past to enter into the main, overview screen. This screen will give you two buttons, a ‘Track’ button, which diverts you to the money-tracking side of the applications, and a ‘Play’ button, which diverts you to the game. This will help keep the application clean instead of bombarding the screen with random information from both sectors of the application. </p>
				<p> Within the ‘Track’ side of the application, you will have the ability to create saving goals and ultimately track your money, in and out. Each goal you set up will be a custom amount, set by the user. Once the goal is set, the application will automatically set ‘goal points’ for the user to achieve - the rewards being used within the game side of the application. These goal points will be set at each quarter of the saving goal. For example, if the goal is to save $1,000.00, the goal points would be $250.00, $500.00, $750.00 and $1,000.00. </p>
				<p> Each saving goal will differ, so sometimes it may be easy to reach these rewards and other times it will be hard. This is where the rewards will differ as well. If you want to put in a saving goal of $50.00, your goal points would be faster to reach and therefore produce smaller rewards. The opposite would apply to larger saving goals. Larger goal points will produce grander rewards. </p>
				<p> The game side of the application will be a lot like your average 2D idle clicker game - rpg style. You will be given a choice to create your character (with options such as race, class, gender, skin tone and a few face and hair options) and begin your quest to build your own army of interesting characters, defeat monsters and work on levelling up to master your class and defeat the ‘Big Boss’. Rewards from the ‘Track’ side will help to level up your character or gain rare allies, armour, weapons, etc. Or, you may just get some currency so you can save up for that master sword you’ve had an eye on. </p>
				<p> The game side won’t rely on your savings goals to be playable, but it will definitely help you progress further faster and will give you rare/limited items that you can’t get without hitting those saving goals. </p>

			<h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
				<p> To successfully create this application, I would need a game development engine (e.g Unreal Engine, Unity, Corona SDK and so on) to create the game. The ‘Track’ side, although not a game, would still be developed in the same engine. For game design (environments, character design, monsters, armour etc.) initial draw ups may be done on paper or in a digital art program such as photoshop or clip studio paint. It can then be further developed within the game engine. </p>

			<h3> Skills Required </h3>
				<p> Many skills would be required for the development of this application. Experience working with game development engines would definitely help create the app smoothly. The ability to read code and understand languages would also be needed. </p>
				<p> For game design, I will need an artist - someone who can creatively design characters and monsters that interest players. They would need experience using digital platforms to create character sketches and design and then be able to apply them to the game dev engine. </p>
				<p> This is a feasible project as I have a lot of experience with the artistic side - character design/digital art programs. The actual creation and development of the game itself would prove more difficult as my knowledge is limited however there are many experienced professionals and hobbyists that I could learn from or recruit to help create the application. </p>

			<h3> Outcome </h3>
				<p> If this project was successful, I believe it will help many people to be motivated when it comes to tracking their money and expenses while still managing to hit those saving goals. </p>
				<p> The more people who are aware of their spending/saving habits, the better. Instead of someone thinking, ‘I’ll just spend $5.00 on this game to progress’, they can save $5.00 and be rewarded and progress in my application instead. Before long, ‘just $5.00’ can accumulate to a hefty amount of money - which if saved, who knows? Maybe you’ll be on that holiday trip sooner than expected. </p>
