			<h1> Interest in IT </h1>
			<article>
				<p> The first spark of interest in I.T began when I was around eight years old, with my older sister playing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64. I would spend hours watching her play and would be completely enraptured by the game and the technology behind it. My interest in technology in general then grew from there. I would play games on the chunky family computer and would tinker with programs like Microsoft Paint or Publisher. My interest in programs continued to grow as I got older and I found video games and creative programs was what I was most drawn to. I realised more recently through a programming game on my Nintendo Switch that I.T was a subject I wanted to have more knowledge on and I wanted to start pursuing as a career. </p>
				<p> When I first realised I wanted to study I.T I found myself at a standstill. Working full time in Accounts, I felt like I had missed my opportunity to grow and change careers as there was no way I could attend university and continue to support myself financially. That’s when I came across online university options and this led me to RMIT. I had heard good things about RMIT from a few family members that are based in Melbourne and so I became confident that this was a university that was going to offer me the education I was looking for in the best way to suit me. </p>
				<p> During my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to learn a lot more about the fundamentals of I.T. My current knowledge base is very limited and I am excited to see how much more there is to learn about. Even from viewing the subjects that are needed to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology, I can already see that there are so many things I wasn’t aware of that are involved in I.T. </p>

				<h2> My Skills </h2>
					<p> 2 columns - 6 skills - evenly placed </p>

				<h2> Why Game Design? </h2>
					<p> Games have always been my interest since a young age. Sitting and watching my sister play, to playing games myself, I have always found them fascinating, and not only because of their storylines and quests. Being able to control a character and explore new worlds through a machine and TV screen is, maybe not very impressive to some, but has always been and will always be an amazing and fascinating feat. </p>
					<p> Being able to work within a team and design a game would be an unbelievable job for me. I believe day to day, the position would continuously challenge designers to stay on top of trends and appeal to their clientele and everyday gamer. </p>
					<p> It would be an ever changing career that would allow me to grow. It would challenge me to be creative and push teh boundaires of video game technology. </p>

				<h2> My Plan for Success </h2>
					<p> Currently, I am completeing a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT. With the degree, I hope to gain the knowledge and skills I need to begin my career in IT. I don't believe I will be making my debut into the IT working world as a Game Designer but will be aiming for an entry level position that allows me to continue to gain experience and further my knowledge in the field. </p>
					<p> Once I have found a foot in the field, I plan to undertake further studies focusing on Game Design specifically. This should help to gain further skills and knowledge and will show future employees that I have taken the time to study further for the career I am aiming towards. I would also love to work on some solo, hobby projects during my own time to slowly build a portfolio of my experience and creative designs in gaming. I believe mobile games will be a great start. </p>
					<p> I am sure as I continue to learn more about IT, my plans may change or morph to better suit but for now, I plan to do my best to aim for a Game Design position. </p>

			<h1> Project Idea </h1>

			<article>
				<h2> Overview </h2>
					<p> This project would be a mobile application that combines both responsibility and recreation. The application would be a tracker of your savings combined with a game. Each time you put money towards your saving goals or each time you hit a certain milestone, you would be rewarded within the game, whether it helps you progress further into the game or rewards you with an item etc. </p>

				<h2> Motivation </h2>
					<p> From a young age, many people within the world get their first job and start saving money. In Australia alone, the average age of first employment is 16 years old. However, there are still  a lot of people who struggle to save money. </p>
					<p> With this application, the aim would be to help motivate people to save money in a fun and enjoyable manner, while still keeping close track of the in and out of their money. Instead of it being an arduous task with messy tracking of information, the application would make saving fun and enjoyable, while still keeping a close eye on your daily finances. </p>
					<p> With an average of 89% of Australians using smartphones daily, this application would appeal to a large market of users who struggle to keep up with saving goals. </p>
