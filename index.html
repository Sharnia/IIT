		<h1> Interest in IT </h1>
			<p> The first spark of interest in I.T began when I was around eight years old, with my older sister playing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64. I would spend hours watching her play and would be completely enraptured by the game and the technology behind it. My interest in technology in general then grew from there. I would play games on the chunky family computer and would tinker with programs like Microsoft Paint or Publisher. My interest in programs continued to grow as I got older and I found video games and creative programs was what I was most drawn to. I realised more recently through a programming game on my Nintendo Switch that I.T was a subject I wanted to have more knowledge on and I wanted to start pursuing as a career. </p>
			<p> When I first realised I wanted to study I.T I found myself at a standstill. Working full time in Accounts, I felt like I had missed my opportunity to grow and change careers as there was no way I could attend university and continue to support myself financially. That’s when I came across online university options and this led me to RMIT. I had heard good things about RMIT from a few family members that are based in Melbourne and so I became confident that this was a university that was going to offer me the education I was looking for in the best way to suit me. </p>
			<p> During my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to learn a lot more about the fundamentals of I.T. My current knowledge base is very limited and I am excited to see how much more there is to learn about. Even from viewing the subjects that are needed to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology, I can already see that there are so many things I wasn’t aware of that are involved in I.T. </p>
